viewmastR is a **[R](https://cran.r-project.org/)** framework for genomic cell type classification 
using the **[Burn](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn)**  machine learning library and its modules.
viewmastR is a very flexible and customizable platform for labelling cell types in your data

The main features of viewmastR are:

* Use a blazingly fast machine learning approach to cell classification according to a reference dataset
* Augment data for rare cell types
* Classify single cell profiles according to a reference of bulk data

## Installation

First you need to have an updated Rust installation. Go to this [site](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to learn how to install Rust.

To install development version of viewmastR:

```r
remotes::install_github("furlan-lab/viewmastR")
```

## How to start

We have a few vignettes for 

- `vignette("HowTo")` to explore the basics of the package. 
- `vignette("Augment")` to explore data augmentation
- `vignette("BulkClassify")` to see how to use a bulk dataset to classify single-cell profiles
